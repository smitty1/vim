Changes made to the vim editor
we can set these in .vimrc and then copy them to all Linux distro's

Edited SolydK's .vimrc file as follows:
	syntax highlighting=on
	background=dark
	Jump to the last position when opened. (Requires plugin I think.)
	Load indentation rules and plugins for the type of file detected.
