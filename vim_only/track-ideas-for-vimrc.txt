Changes made to the vim editor
we can set these in .vimrc and then copy them to all Linux distro's

Edited SolydK's .vimrc file as follows:
	sntax highlighting=on
	background=dark
	Jump to the last position when opened. (Requires plugin I think.)
	Load indentation rules and plugins for the type of file detected.
	set number
	colorscheme slate
syntax, number, and colorscheme have been added	to the .vimrc.
.vimrc, .bashrc, .absh_aliases, and .bash_functions added to my git/vim repository. This way should be better than trying to use Dropbox for keeping all my files synchronized
