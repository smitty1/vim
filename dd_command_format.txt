The dd command is used to write a *.iso file to a cd/dvd/usb.
The command is destructive, it will erase all information on the destination.
My usage is maiunly to usb sticks.

Needed:
	An iso file downloaded from the project site
	A file with the checksum for the download
	A usb stick of sufficient size.
After the downloads check the integity of the downloaded file. For instance for Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-27-1.6.iso in the downloads folder.
Download the checksums to a file fedora.sha256 in the Downloads folder and run the following command:
		sha256sum -c fedora.sha256
	ksha256sum calulates the SHA256 checksum of, in this case, each file in the directory.
	The -c tells the command to check the given file for a matching checksum.
	If it finds a match it will print the file name followed by OK
Assuming the checksum matches, write the iso to the usb stick using dd.

Insert the usb staick into the slot on the computer.
**********Extremely Important*********************
Make CERTAIN of the device designation for the usb stick.
In a terminal window type:   "dmesg | tail  "
look for a message similar to "[sdx] Attached SCSI removable disk
The sdx where x is usually b,c,d etc is the designation for the usb stick ie. /dev/sdb

dd must be run as root				
 Usefull form of the command 
 su -c "dd if=/path/to/iso/file of=/path/to/usb bs 8M status=progress oflag=direct
	if (input file) with path
	of (output file) with apth
	8M blocksize 4M, 4096b, or 8M
	status=progress prints some progress figure as the write occurs, better than a blank screen & wondering.
		SolydX, Linux Mint Debian Fedora all support progress, some others do not.
So for example
	dd of=~Downloads/Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-27-1.6.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=8M status=progress oflag=direct
Wrote the Fedora 27 Live Workstation iso to the usb stick designated as /dev/sdb in 320 sec using a USB 2.0 stick, using either USB 2 0r 3 port.

39 seconds using a USB 3.0 stick in a USB 3 port
63 seconds using a USB 3.0 stick in a USB 2 port
